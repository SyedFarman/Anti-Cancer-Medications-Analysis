# Anti-Cancer-Medications-Analysis
Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.


## Project Overview
In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

## Analysis

- There is a positive correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume
- Mouse which are treated on Capomulin drug saw a decrease in Tumor Volume.
- Ramicane is the best drug so far, which shows lowest Tumor volume and mean, median values
